Releasing
=========

 1. Update the CHANGELOG.md with the version and date 
 2. Go to [GH Releases](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-android/releases)
 3. Choose a tag name (e.g. `3.0.0`), this is the version number of the release.
     1. Preview releases follow the pattern `3.0.0-alpha.1`, `3.0.0-beta.1`, `3.0.0-RC.1`
 4. Choose a release name (e.g. `3.0.0`), ideally it matches the above.
 5. Write a description of the release.
 6. Publish the release.
     1. The release will be published as a Draft, so you have to publish it again after CI is done.
 7. GH Action (release.yml) is doing everything else automatically.
 8. Done.
